To expedite running the workspace and having a consistent project environment, we’ll be using GitHub codespaces.
To start, open the [azure-content-safety-workshop GitHub repo](https://github.com/nitya/rai-content-safety-workshop). You can use a pre-built development environment. **Click the button below** to open the repo in GitHub Codespaces, and then continue the readme!

This will launch a Codespaces environment with all the dependencies installed.  Once the environment is ready, you can run the following commands to create the Azure resources and run the sample code.

**Note**: You can also access the codespaces by clicking on the green **Code** button in the top right of the repo.  Then selecting the **Codespaces** tab and clicking on the **Create codespace on main** button to launch the Codespaces environement.
