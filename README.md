# Responsible AI Hub

Welcome to the Responsible AI Hub for Developers with all levels of expertise in AI and Machine Learning. This is a dedicated space to help the community discover relevant training resources and events to learn about Responsible AI.

## View Hub Website
You can visit the hosted [Responsible AI Hub](https://aka.ms/rai-hub/website) site to learn about upcoming training events, or to explore _self-guided workshops_ to skill up on topics like:
- The Responsible AI Dashboard
- Azure Content Safety
- Azure Prompt Flow

## Build & Preview Site

Want to contribute content? Start by making sure you can build and preview the site in a relevant development environment.

The project is instrumented with a _dev container_, making it easy to launch using either Github Codespaces (in the cloud) or Docker Desktop (in your local device). 

The project is built using the [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/) static site generator.
Once the container is running, use these commands to build and preview the site:

```bash
cd website/
npm run start
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
> website@0.0.0 start
> docusaurus start

[INFO] Starting the development server...
[SUCCESS] Docusaurus website is running at: http://localhost:3000/
```

You can now open the browser to that URL to see the site in preview mode. As you make changes to the content, the site preview will automatically refresh to show those updates.

To learn more about how the website is configured and structured, see the [Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs).
